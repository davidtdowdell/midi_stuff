This was a project I spent a snow day working on in college; 
it converts MIDI input (in our case from an electronic drum kit or keyboard) into simulated keyboard presses.
With the right key bindings, one can then control a video game (such as Mario Kart via Dolphin emulator)
using a piano keyboard or drum set, a truly unique experience.

Each script is meant to run independently, its name should explain its use.
